# Mod Jam Ideas

# 1
Move the frog and add way more flies
(Use the arrow keys or something to move the frog around and add more flies to make it more challenging. Frog movement would be a challenge.)
# 2
Have TWO frogs compete
(co-op game with WASD and arrow keys to control separate frogs and compete for the highest score)
# 3
From frogs and flies to cats and mice
(Instead of frogs and flies, change the game to be a cat catching mice. Would require more movement)
# 4
Make the frog a chameleon and add different insects
(Instead of a frog, let it be a chameleon, catching a multitude of insects with its super long tongue)
# 5
A bird that eats fish
(Change the concept a bit more, where fish jump out of the water, and the player is a bird that swoops down and catches them. All the movement would be difficult)
# 6
Hold down to determine tongue length
(A different tongue mechanic where you have to hold down to charge and then release to shoot the tongue. The longer the hold, the further the reach. This would make the game more challenging for the player)
# 7
Timed sliding bar to control the length
(Similar concept but instead make a slider that is constantly going up and down and you have to time the release to get a certain tongue length)
# 8
Frog has to navigate a maze
(The player has to navitgate a maze while they defend themself. Collision physics might be difficult)
# 9
Day night cycle, and you become the prey
(During the night, the game changes and you become the hunted)
# 10
Frog can jump
(A mechanic where the frog can jump and move around. The jump could have a cooldown)
# 11
Use Firebase to make it multiplayer **SUPER AMBITIOUS**
(This one's definitely a long shot. I've tried using Firebase before but I'm not even entirely sure if this would work. Essentially this would use server side variables that and something like a peer-to-peer system to match the players' positions. Would be a lot of work for sure)
# 12
Frog asks math questions
(Let's turn this into an educational game! The player will be asked math questions before continuing)
# 13
Frog explores different places
(The player is transported to different biomes through some sort of level system. This might require a lot of illustration)
# 14
Frog explodes if it eats too much too quickly
(There is more strategy involved here because if you eat too much too quickly, you will explode! Explosion animation might be complicated?)
# 15
Frog changes colours
(The frog changes colours randomnly and periodically. If you eat a fly while it's red, for example, you lose)
# 16
Flies are smart
(Give the flies programmed intelligence to make the game more difficult and interesting)
# 17
Flies get bigger the longer they're alive
(The flies have a lifespan and they get bigger. However, it's slightly random and you don't know when they will die. Risk waiting in order to get more points from eating bigger flies, or play it safe by only eating smaller ones!)
# 18
Make it like Fruit Ninja
(Insects get tossed up like in the Fruit Ninja game, and you get a score based on how perfect your catches are)
# 19
Frog tongue can bend
(A mechanic where the tongue is a little more flexible and can bend more towards where the player points it)
# 20
Flies become faster overtime (levels)
(The flies speed up and become increasingly random after each level pass)
