This is so overtimulating, I love it. I think maybe an epilepsy warning would be nice for when you answer 'no' to the question at the beginning. It's great that you took the time to implement a backstory to your project. It's an easy way to elevate any simple game. Just from an accessibility standpoint, consider giving the text on the instructions page a higher contrast ratio with the background because I'm finding it quite hard to read and I'm not visually impaired. A way to restart the game would be a good addition I think.

Looking at the code, I would recommend using some for loops to display the flies and fairies since you have enough that it would make it cleaner.

I like the idea to use emojis for decorating the background as text elements.

Super inventive in the concept overall and good commenting, maybe missing only a few in places.

This game is so fun but also pretty difficult. Unfortunately for me that's just be a skill issue on my end. The sounds that you added make it much more satisfying and addictive to play and so do the motivating comments that the frog makes when you lose or win. It's genuinly frustrating to try and get the flies, which I believe works in your favour in wanting to make us play more. Good idea to randomly generate the levels, because then you can have an infinite amount. I like that you added a restart button and the controls are all listed on the title screen. Only thing I would say is to make sure that the grammar reads nicely.

In the code, a minor thing, but make sure the indentation is consistent for proper readability.

In your draw function, you have two instances of the gamestate === 'instructions' if statement when you can put everything in one.

Glad to see you're heavy on the commenting, it really helps parse throuh the code.

Nice use of for loops to display the blocks.

You certainly went above and beyond on the modification of this project!

Loving the green broccoli theme throughout the game. This is is overall a great example of a simple and well executed modification to the original project. The original bones are still there but it's a funny spin on it to make it much more interesting. I like how the frog gets smaller or bigger depending on if you eat a hamburger or broccoli. And the eyes follow from left to right, that's a nice touch. Not to mention the sound effects also make the experience that much more enjoyable. I am now regretting not adding any to mine! There also seems to be an underlying message to this game of how there will be more burgers thrown your way but you have to try and choose to eat healthy.

Would've been nice to have some screenshots of the game in the README!

Funny how you're still calling them flies in the code, which obviously doesn't actually matter but it may be confusing to someone trying to dissect the project.

It seems you have a few bits that are still commented out. Don't forget about them! If they serve no purpose, they should be deleted before it's made live.

Didn't know you could literally use a space to check for the space key being pressed in the keyPressed function. Ex: key === " "

Overall a great modification to the original and solid execution.
